# About Me
- University of Toronto Computer Engineering student specializing in software development
- Mostly experienced in C++ but always trying to branch out and learn new things üòÅ

# What's my Passion?
I like figuring out how things work, and how I can make them better. Specifically I seek out interesting problems that stress my creativity, and challenge me to continuously look for better solutions. 

Generally I prefer lower level languages like C++ and Rust, but am very adaptable to learning new languages and technologies, even if that language is Objective-C. 

# What am I up to right now?

I should be finishing my website and the other projects I started and never finished, but instead I've been bogged down in my final year of university.
